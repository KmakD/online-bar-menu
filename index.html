        <img src='black-russian.jpg' alt='Black Russian' class='drink-image' />
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vodka, Coffee Liqueur, Ice</p>
        <p>The black russian was invented in 1949 by Gustave Tops, a Belgian barman, and now it is an IBA official
          cocktail. The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a stereotypical Russian spirit, and the blackness of
          the coffee liqueur.</p>

        <h3>Screwdriver</h3>
        <img src='screwdriver.jpeg' alt='Screwdriver' class='drink-image' />
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vodka, Orange Juice, Orange, Ice</p>
        <p>A simple and popular IBA official cocktail. The drink reportedly got its name because American petroleum
          engineers in Saudi Arabia secretly added vodka to small cans of orange juice and stirred the mixture with
          their screwdrivers.</p>
