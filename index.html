        <img src='black-russian.jpg' alt='Black Russian' class='drink-image' />
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vodka, Coffee Liqueur, Ice</p>
        <p>The black russian was invented in 1949 by Gustave Tops, a Belgian barman, and now it is an IBA official
          cocktail. The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a stereotypical Russian spirit, and the blackness of
          the coffee liqueur.</p>

        <h3>Screwdriver</h3>
        <img src='screwdriver.jpeg' alt='Screwdriver' class='drink-image' />
        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vodka, Orange Juice, Orange, Ice</p>
        <p>A simple and popular IBA official cocktail. The drink reportedly got its name because American petroleum
          engineers in Saudi Arabia secretly added vodka to small cans of orange juice and stirred the mixture with
          their screwdrivers.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Whiskey, Lemon, Sugar Syrup, Egg, Ice</p>
        <p>An IBA official pre-dinner cocktail. The oldest historical mention of a whiskey sour dates back to a
          newspaper published in Wisconsin, USA, in 1870. This version is a bit sweeter and stronger than the official
          cocktail and feels more balanced.</p>

        <p>A variation of the classic “White Russian” cocktail made with whiskey instead of vodka, creating a different
          yet familiar experience for those who enjoy a creamy and smooth cocktail.</p>

          often omits lime juice.</p>
