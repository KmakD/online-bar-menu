        <p>The black russian was invented in 1949 by Gustave Tops, a Belgian barman, and now it is an IBA official
          cocktail. The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a stereotypical Russian spirit, and the blackness of
          the coffee liqueur.</p>

        <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vodka, Orange Juice, Orange, Ice</p>
        <p>A simple and popular IBA official cocktail. The drink reportedly got its name because American petroleum

          their screwdrivers.</p>
